## ⛰️ First Sip: The Story Behind Coupling

The idea of Coupling was born out of inspiration during a [week-long wilderness trip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiAthLL0Wsc) with my partner, Heidi. We had just escaped heavy wildfire smoke at the top of a remote, unmarked Yosemite mountain pass at 12,000 feet, and battled thirst after our water supply dwindled climbing back out the range.

As Heidi began teaching me Chinese words to pass the miles, I was like, wait: **why had I been trying to learn Chinese on my own when I had the best teacher right beside me who was emotionally invested in my progress?**

The idea for the name followed on shortly after, **Coupling**: symbolizing not just couples but also the melding of language (ling) and connection. Just as couplings are mechanical components that transmit power between two parts, **Coupling is the conduit for language and understanding between you and your partner**.

I asked around and listened to stories of many couples trying to learn languages from each other, all ending in failure or disaster. **I felt I found a problem worth solving.** Coupling doesn't aim to just solve language barriers; I want it to deepen understanding, lower cultural walls, and most importantly, make a fun activity that adds another layer to relationships.

## 📝 Insights Learned From the Webapp Prototype

**Big thanks to everyone who tried out the early versions of Coupling** and shared their thoughts. It really helped shape the direction today.

Here's what I learned. At first, I thought making things super easy for partners by having a library of ready-made content was the way to go. Then I pulled in the partner too much by pivoting towards live language mini-games. However, I've come to see that **Coupling truly comes alive when we enable partners to take an active but asynchronous role.**

Now, learners pick what they want to learn, prompting partners to craft content that's personalized and spot-on accurate. This shift sparked **a sense of mutual investment**. Learners dive in deeper, motivated by their partner's dedicated efforts, while partners are engaged by seeing the positive contributions to the learner's progress.

## ☕ What's Brewing?
